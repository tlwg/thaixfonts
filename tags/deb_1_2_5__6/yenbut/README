X11 Release 5 or later version allows 8-bit character set to be used.
The thai9x13 font takes advantage of the feature.

The fonts were built by using Borland's stroked font editor, and then
converted to BDF format. It contains most of Thai symbols and letters
(if not all) according to TIS-620 code.

If X server runs on the same machine where the fonts live, the
following steps will typically make fonts available to X server.

- Create a subdirectory, ~/xfont (or any other name).
- Copy fonts to the directory.
- Convert font bdf format to pcf format by the following commands:

	bdftopcf thai8x13.bdf > thai8x13.pcf
	bdftopcf thai9x13.bdf > thai9x13.pcf

- Make a font directory file, fonts.dir, in the directory with the command:
 
	mkfontdir ~/xfont
    
- Make path of the font subdirectory known to the X server with command:

	xset +fp ~/xfont.

Now the fonts should be usable to xterm or other applications.
For example,
		xterm -fn thai8x13

The procedure may vary from site to site and may not work at all if
X terminal is used.  Please consult your gurus at your site for details.
